# Udemy-MySQL-for-Data-Analytics-and-Business-Intelligence

Welcome to this repo, which was created to host the SQL queries I practiced on MySQL Workbench 8.0 as part of the **MySQL for Data Analytics and Business Intelligence** course by **365 Careers** available on Udemy.

This repository showcases my skills and projects in MySQL. You will find various .sql files ordered by topics that I learned and applied in MY SQL as:

- SQL SELECT
- SQL UPDATE
- SQL DELETE
- SQL Aggregate Functions
- SQL JOINS
- SQL SUBQUERIES
- SQL SELF JOIN
- SQL WINDOW Functions ROW_NUMBER,RANK(),DENSE_RANK(),LEAD(),LAG()
- SQL COMMON TABLE Expressions (CTES)
- SQL Temporary Tables
- Combining SQL and Tableau

Feel free to explore and contact me if you have any questions about the queries or feedback.
